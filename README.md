RANDOM CIRCLE GRAPHICS GENERATOR WITH EXAMPLE FILES

these python/numpy notebooks create randomly generated circle art. the code selects a random background color and selects randomly located and sized circles based on a randomly selected color palette, colors within the palette, and transparency. i used a bash script to run the second notebook 10000 times and created a library of wonderful circle art.
